# Autohotkey to make fancy zones
I wrote this code to create three window and two multitasking workspace.
like in fancy zones.
this was really useful for me. the left window is the largest,
right two windows are of the same size. if you press left alt + 3 and inverse if you press right alt +2. i use the left window to work on
while using the other two as references. when on let alt +3

similar case for 2 window system.

guide to use it:
download this .ahk file, also download and install autohotkey v2 and then save the .ahk to Startup folder
