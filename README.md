# Autohotkey
I wrote this code to create three window multitasking workspace.
like in fancy zones.
this was really useful for me. the left window is the largest,
right two windows are of the same size. i use the left window to work on
while using the other two as references.

tiles pixel size: 740-640-640

guide to use it:
download this .ahk file, also download and install autohotkey v2 and then save the .ahk to Startup folder
